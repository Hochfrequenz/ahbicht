# Mussfeldprüfung / Condition check

Condition check (Mussfeldprüfung), that examines and evaluates expressions like `Muss [59] U ([123] O [456])` from the AHBs (edi@energy documents) by parsing it with the [parsing library `lark`](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

## Functionality

(as of 2021-06-11)

- Expressions can contain single numbers e.g. `[47]` or numbers combined with `U`/`O`/`X` which are translated to boolean operators `and`/`or`/`exclusive or`, e.g. `[45]U[2]` or they can be combined **without** an operator, e.g. `[930][5]` in the case of FormatConstraints.
- Expressions can contain random whitespaces.
- Input conditions are passed in form of a `ConditionNode`, see below.
- Bedingungen/`RequirementConstraints` with a boolean value, Hinweise/`Hints` and Formatdefinitionen/`FormatConstraints` are so far functionally implemented as the result returns if the condition expression is fulfilled and which Hints and FormatConstraints are relevant.
- The boolean logic follows 'brackets `( )` before `then_also` before `and` before `or`'.
- Hints and UnevaluatedFormatConstraints are implemented as `neutral` element, so not changing the boolean outcome of an expression for the evaluation regarding the requirement constraints and raising errors when there is no sensible logical outcome of the expression.
- A `condition_fulfilled` attribute can also take the value `unknown`.
- Brackets e.g. `([43]O[4])U[5]`
- Requirement indicators (i.e `Muss`, `Soll`, `Kann`, `X`, `O`, `U`) are seperated from the condition expressions and also seperated into single requirement indicator expressions if there are more than one (for modal marks).
- `Format Constraint Expressions` that are returned after the requirement condition evaluation can now be parsed and evaluated.
- Evaluate several modal marks in one ahb_expression: the first one that evaluates to fulfilled is the valid one.

### In planning:

- Evaluate requirement indicators:
  - Soll, Kann, Muss, X, O, U -> is_required, is_forbidden, etc...

The decision if a requirement constraint is met / fulfilled / true is made in the content evaluation module. See [its README](evaluation/README_Evaluation.md).

## Program structure

The following diagram shows the structure of the condition check for more than one condition. If it is only a single condition or just a requirement indicator, the respective tree consists of just this token and the result equals the input.

The raw and updated data for this diagram can be found in the [draw_io_charts repository](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/draw_io_charts/tree/main/wimbee/conditions) and edited under [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/#HHochfrequenz%2Fdraw_io_charts%2Fmain%2Fwimbee%2Fconditions%2FCondition_Structure_with_more_than_one_condition.drawio) with your GitHub Account.

## Truth tables

Additionally to the usual boolean logic we also have `neutral` elements (e.g. `Hints`, `UnevaluatedFormatConstraints` and in some cases `EvaluatedCompositions`) or `unknown` requirement constraints. They are handled as follows:

### `and_composition`

| A       | B       | A U B   |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Neutral | True    | True    |
| Neutral | False   | False   |
| Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| Unknown | True    | Unknown |
| Unknown | False   | False   |
| Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |
| Unknown | Neutral | Unknown |

### `or_composition`

| A       | B       | A O B               | note                                             |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Neutral | True    | does not make sense |
| Neutral | False   | does not make sense |
| Neutral | Neutral | Neutral             | no or_compositions of hint and format constraint |
| Unknown | True    | True                |
| Unknown | False   | Unknown             |
| Unknown | Unknown | Unknown             |
| Unknown | Neutral | does not make sense |

### `xor_composition`

| A       | B       | A X B               | note                                              |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Neutral | True    | does not make sense |
| Neutral | False   | does not make sense |
| Neutral | Neutral | Neutral             | no xor_compositions of hint and format constraint |
| Unkown  | True    | Unknown             |
| Unkown  | False   | Unknown             |
| Unkown  | Unknown | Unknown             |
| Unkown  | Neutral | does not make sense |
