"""
This module contains the abstract class ConditionNode, which specifies the nodes of the parsed tree.
The type of the subclass is the decisive factor on how the respective node
is handled in the context of the compositions it is used in.
There are three possible input nodes (RequirementConstraint, Hint and FormatConstraint) and
the EvaluatedComposition node which results from a combination of two nodes (of all possible types).

The used terms are defined in the README_conditions.md.
