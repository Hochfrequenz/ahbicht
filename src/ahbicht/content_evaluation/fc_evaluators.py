"""
A format constraint (FC) evaluator is an evaluator for format constraints.
Think of stuff like:
* strings that should match an OBIS regex
* MarktlokationsIDs having correct check sums
* pre/post decimal values having specific ranges
Other than requirement constraints format constraints do not affect if data are required at all, but instead only
validate already required data.

This context variable holds the text that is to be analysed/evaluated by the format constraint evaluator.
It will always return the "correct" value in your context. You only have to manually set this context variable if you're
evaluating an expression outside the validation framework.
The conceptual difference to the EvaluatableData which are dependency injected using the EvaluatableDataProvider is,
that the data evaluated in a format constraint (via the context variable) vary over the time span of one validation run.
The EvaluatableData are stable in that regard.
"""

# The idea behind the context variable is to avoid passing the string/text to be evaluated by FC evaluators through many
# layers of code (including lark classes like transformers where we formerly had the string as constructor argument).
# Now it needs to be set once and only once when the entered input is determined (e.g. when reading user input).
# Then we can forget about it, it does not bloat our function signatures (where in >90% of the cases it has just been
# forwarded to the next layer of code).
# The context variable also greatly simplifies the debugging/error analysis.
# Instead of tracing the entered input all the way down from the ahbicht API to the FC Evaluator method,
# you now just need to watch the two places in the code where the values are actually set:
# 1. in the ahbicht code base in the validation
# 2. in custom code using ahbicht(?)
# The single evaluation methods of the FC evaluators (e.g. "def evaluate_987") are still provided with the value as a
# usual function argument to prevent the methods from needing to access the context variable themselves.
