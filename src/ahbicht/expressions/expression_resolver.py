    """
    The TimeConditionEvaluator replaces "time conditions" (aka "UB1", "UB2", "UB3") with evaluatable format constraints.
    This is not what BDEW suggests us to do in the "Allgemeine Festlegungen". BDEW says that "UBx" conditions have to be
    expanded just like packages: For example "UB1" shall be expanded to "([931] ∧ [932] [490]) ⊻ ([931] ∧ [933] [491])".

    This just doesn't work out for multiple reasons:

    1. Other than _all_ the other requirement constraints RC 490, 491, 492 and 493 are self-referencing.
    While "normal" RCs act like "You have to provide this ("Foo") if the other thing ("Bar") meets a requirement",
    the 49x RCs are of kind "This ("Foo") has to meet certain requirements (e.g. the end of a German day), regardless
    of the other things ("Bar"). So the usual requirement constraint evaluation approach ("Search for Bar and derive
    from there what it means for this (Foo)") won't work and is overly complicated, too.
    Also, if the pseudo requirement constraint 490-493 is UNFULFILLED, this does _not_ mean that the data must not
    be provided which is also a different behaviour compared to usual requirement constraints.

    2. No one who understands the concept of datetime+offset and is able to parse datetime+offset nowadays cares, if you
    use ("x datetime" with an "0 offset") or ("x+z datetime" that has a "z offset") instead. It's just BDEWs home-brewed
    EDIFACT serialization rule that, for no real reason, restricts us to set the offset z to "+00:00" always.
    https://imgflip.com/i/65giq5

    AHBicht won't restrict you to use datetime offset=="+00:00". Because we don't care and you should not care.
    The scope of AHBicht is to evaluate expressions and data, not to obey pointless BDEW EDIFACT rules.
    Also this default transformer won't expand the UBx conditions into something which is overly complicated and in the
    end does really fit (for above reasons).

    That being said… the thing that actually happens is:
    UBx will be replaced with a format constraint (plus a requirement constraint in case of UB3) that is fulfilled,
    if and only if the value provided obeys the original *meaning* of UBx.
    So the data provided will be evaluated just as you'd expect them to be evaluated but without all the bureaucracy.

    Condition UB1 checks if the datetime provided is the (inclusive) start / (exclusive) end of a German "Stromtag".
    Condition UB1 will be replaced with the format constraint 932.

    Condition UB2 checks if the datetime provided is the (inclusive) start / (exclusive) end of a German "Gastag".
    Condition UB2 will be replaced with the format constraint 934.

    Condition UB3 checks if the datetime provided is the (inclusive) start / (exclusive) end of a German "Stromtag" if
    the receiver is from division electricity (RC 492) or a "Gastag" if a receiver is from division gas (RC 493).
    Condition UB3 will be replaced with two XOR connected format constraints, each of them coupled to a requirement
    constraint for the respective division.
